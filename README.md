## Features  
- **Logical Expression Parsing**: Efficiently parses and evaluates logical expressions for circuit analysis.  
- **Truth Table Generation**: Converts logical expressions into detailed truth tables.  
- **Simulation**: Tests circuit behavior based on logical input combinations.  

## Data Structures Used  
1. **Stacks**: Parse logical expressions using postfix (RPN) notation.  
2. **Queues**: Handle sequential operations in circuits.  
3. **Arrays**: Store and manage input/output states for truth table generation.  

## Usage  
1. Input a logical expression (e.g., `A & B | C`).  
2. Generate the corresponding truth table.  
3. Simulate the circuit outputs for given inputs.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Addition of support for multi-level circuit simulations.  
- Enhanced error handling for invalid expressions.
